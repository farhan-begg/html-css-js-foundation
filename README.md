My Notes
# JavaScript
Primitive Types in JS
- Number
- String 
- Boolean 
- Null 
- Undefined 

Numbers
- Js has one number type
- Positive Numbers 
- Negative Numbers
- Whole numbers (integers)
- Decimal numbers (floats)

------------------------------------
Booleans 
another primitive type
- True or False values

Variables can change types

----------------------------------
Strings represent text and must be wrapped in quotes
- Strings are indexed, each character has a corresponding index
( positional number)

example 
let animal = "Dumbo Octopus"
animal[0]  
//result  D

Methods are built in actions we can perform with individial strings

They helps us do things like
- Searching within a string
- replacing part of a string
- changing the casing of string

.length is a property not a method

thing.method()

example 
let msg = "fbgm"
msg.toUpperCase() //returns "FBGM"

.trim() -- trims leading and trailing spaces
